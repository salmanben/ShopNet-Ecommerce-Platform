## Getting Started
To use ShopNet Ecommerce Platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Execute the script in the shopnet.sql file to create the database named shopnet, along with the necessary tables. and also to create the main admin account (the main admin can deactivate other admin accounts but other admins can't deactivate the account of another admin. The main admin must have id=1, so don't change its id after executing the SQL script).

3. Once the admin account is created, you can access the admin login page using this URL: [Admin Login Page](http://localhost/shopnet/control/admin/login/login.php).

4. Use these credentials to log in:
   - Email: benomarsalman112@gmail.com
   - Password: 12345

5. After logging in, navigate to the settings page and update your credentials, especially your email, to enable password reset functionality in case you forget your password.

6. Update the client ID to allow payments using PayPal. You can do this from the settings page as well.

7. Additionally, update the email settings from the same page to allow sending emails to users when they forget their passwords.
   
8. Please note that the products displayed in the slider on the home page are the most sold products. Therefore, the slider will be empty initially. To populate the slider, you need to have at least 5 products sold. So, buy at least 5 products to have products displayed in the slider.
